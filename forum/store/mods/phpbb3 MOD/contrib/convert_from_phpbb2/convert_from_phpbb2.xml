    <author-notes lang="en-gb"><![CDATA[This portion of the mod converts your phpBB2 wp-united to phpBB3.
It is only necessary if you have lots of users that are already integrated, and you want to preserve this during a phpBB2 -> phpBB3 conversion.
If you don't have user integration turned on, you don't need this.

    <diy-instructions lang="en-gb">
1. First -- install phpBB3 and ensure it is working. Then, install WP-United, then this mod. Don't run the WP-United Setup Wizard yet!

2. Then, disable your phpBB2 board, and run the phpBB2 - phpBB3 convertor. Once completed, run the WP-United install script again.

3. Run the WP-United Setup Wizard, setting everything to how you had it under phpBB2. Remember to review the new WP-United permissions -- they control how users are integrated.

4. Finally, run the user mapping tool, and ensure that the users are mapped correctly.

IMPORTANT -- Before you begin, back everything up! If this is your first time converting to phpBB3,
do a few trial runs of the conversion first, so you can get a feel for how it should work.
